# Random-Projects
Repository which contains a variety of random programs/Jupyter Notebooks I made.

Toronto Weather Analysis Notebook: practicing random forest and getting familiar with Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit learn and other applied data science packages in Python to predict Toronto's weather

Fridget Google Vision Notebook: first step in image recognition for food, to see how useful Google Vision could be in creating a retrofit smart fridge

Endgame-Mailer: script to take data of the top 25 highest grossing movies and send an email to myself. Made after the release of Avengers Endgame, to see when/if the film would overtake Avatar.
